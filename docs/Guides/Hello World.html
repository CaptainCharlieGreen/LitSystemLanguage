<p>This guide will walk you through a simple Strat system.  You'll create a system and deploy it to your local computer then take that system and deploy it to AWS.  There are no mysterious repositories to clone--every line of code you need is here in this guide.  You will need to install <a href="./Getting%20Started">stratc</a>, Strat's compiler, and if you wish to deploy to AWS you will need an account that you're comfortable deploying things to.</p>
<h1 id="localhelloworld">Local Hello World</h1>
<p>Create a file "HelloWorld.st" and paste the following into it:</p>
<pre><code class="strat language-strat">service HelloWorld {
  include "Http"

  Http { method: "get", path: "*" } -&gt;
    helloWorld ():any -&gt;
      "./helloWorld.js"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Create a file "helloWorld.js" in the same directory and paste the following into it:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">module.exports = () =&gt; `Hello World at ${Date.now()}!`
</code></pre>
<p>Build and deploy HelloWorld.st:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">$ stratc ./HelloWorld.st &amp;&amp; stratc ./HelloWorld.sa
</code></pre>
<p>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a> in your browser</p>
<h1 id="thebasics">The Basics</h1>
<p>Strat is all about events and functions.  Its sole purpose is to describe what events and functions exist in your system and how those events are handled by those functions.</p>
<p>An event is a single piece of serialized data that is passed into your system.  Events come from sources, and in this example we're including Http, which is the event source for http requests provided by Strat's standard library.  Including Http tells Strat that the HelloWorld service accepts http events, or in more familiar terms, that the HelloWorld service is a web server.</p>
<p>A function is a single computational unit within your system, and it represents the actual code that gets deployed.  Functions accept events and execute code, and services are groupings of functions that control permissions.</p>
<p>The first step is to run stratc on HelloWorld.st, which creates a HelloWorld.sa file, which is a deployable bundle of the entire system.  Sa files can be moved from computer to computer and contain version and other metadata about your system that make them ideal CI/CD artifacts.  Then, we deploy that .sa file to your local computer.  We could also deploy that same .sa file to the AWS substrate, but we'll keep things simple for now.</p>
<h2 id="linebylinebreakdown">Line by line breakdown</h2>
<pre><code>service HelloWorld {
</code></pre>
<p>Here we declare a service HelloWorld.  All functions must reside within a service.  Outside of providing grouping for functions, services also control roles and permissions within your system.  Access control in Strat systems behaves like scope in a language like Java.</p>
<pre><code>include "Http"
</code></pre>
<p>Including Http lets us receive Http events and tells Strat this is a web server.</p>
<pre><code>Http { method: "get", path: "*" } -&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is an event pattern, and the gist here is we're describing what type of Http event should be sent to the following function.  This can be translated as "Http get requests on any path should be sent to the following function".</p>
<pre><code>helloWorld ():any -&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is a function signature, complete with a function name, input type within the parens (in this case, no input type), and output type after the colon.  Types are not implemented yet in Strat, so this function returns the any type while in the future it will return "text".</p>
<pre><code>"./helloWorld.js"
</code></pre>
<p>This is the final part of a function definition--the <a href="../User%20Guide/Artifacts">artifact</a>.  This is the code that will be run in response to the http event declared above.  For now, assume that this .js file will be run by NodeJs…somewhere…more on code execution can be found in the <a href="../Specification/Functions">functions section of the specification</a>.  The power of Strat lies in users not specifying what type of infrastructure helloWorld.js executes on.  This allows stratc to port systems between wildly different substrates and optimize systems.</p>
<h1 id="awshelloworld">AWS Hello World</h1>
<p>Now that you're acquainted with the basics of Strat, lets do something more exciting--run this on real, production worthy infrastructure.  You'll need an AWS account, so if you don't have one go <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=default&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start">create one now</a>--its easy, requires no upfront financial commitment, and won't cost you anything to run this system thanks to generous free tiers.</p>
<p>Stratc will need to create resources on your AWS account and will need credentials to do that, so go ahead and set up your shared credentials file by following the instructions <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html">here</a>.
Note: you may already have one--make sure its for your test account!</p>
<p>Now you're ready to deploy to AWS:</p>
<pre><code class="sh language-sh">  $ stratc --aws ./HelloWorld.sa
</code></pre>
<p>You'll see stratc create resources in the console.  Look for the APIGateway URL and go there.  The first load takes up to 10 seconds as AWS loads your resources for the first time.</p>
