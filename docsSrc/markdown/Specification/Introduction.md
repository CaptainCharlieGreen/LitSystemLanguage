# Specification Introduction

This spec is a work in progress.  Since Strat compiles into a "bytecode" .sa format, there are two specifications:

  - The specification for the Strat Cloud Language, which is meant as a more informal usage guide leaning on the "the implementation is the spec" mentality
  - The specification for the .sa file format and its semantics, which is a more strict document as many different vendors will be implementing competing substrates that execute .sa files.
