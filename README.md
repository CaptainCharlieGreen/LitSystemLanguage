# The Strat Cloud Language

Strat is a language to represent and deploy portable cloud systems.

Compile your system componets and .st files into system artifact (.saf) files.  Then, deploy those .saf files to any strat virtual substrate (SVS) implementation.  Strat does for cloud infrastructure what Java does for computers.

Currently supported SVS implementations:

  - AWS (using Lambda, APIGateway, S3, etc.)
  - Single computers

**Strat's goal is to represent basic system concepts as simply as possible and make those concepts work across not only modern production infrastructure but also local development environments.**
